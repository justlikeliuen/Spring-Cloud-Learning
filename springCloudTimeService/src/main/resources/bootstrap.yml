#It is a good idea to set the spring.application.name (in bootstrap.yml or application.yml)
#if your application needs any application-specific configuration from the server.
#spring:
#  application:
#    name: timeService
#  profiles:
#    active: dev
#  #This is the default behaviour for any application which has the Spring Cloud Config Client on the classpath.
#  #When a config client starts up it binds to the Config Server
#  #(via the bootstrap configuration property spring.cloud.config.uri) and initializes Spring Environment with remote property sources.
